# push_swap
This project involves sorting a set of numbers in a stack using a series of specific operations that manipulate two stacks: a and b. Initially, 'a' contains a random sequence of unique positive and/or negative numbers, while b starts empty. The goal is to arrange all numbers in a in ascending order by performing a set of predefined moves to reorganize elements between the two stacks.<br/>
<br/>
The allowed operations include swapping the top two elements of a or b, pushing the top element from one stack to the other, rotating all elements in a stack up or down, and performing combined moves on both stacks simultaneously. These operations must be strategically used to sort a in the fewest moves possible.
